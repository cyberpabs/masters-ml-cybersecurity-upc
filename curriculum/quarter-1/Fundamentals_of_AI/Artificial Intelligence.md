Is a broad and transformative field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

At its core, AI involves machines that can simulate cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.

## Key Components and Subfields of AI

AI is an umbrella term encompassing several specialized areas, many of which relate to the Neural Network architectures we discussed:

| Subfield                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                            | Example Application                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Machine Learning]] (ML)**             | The most common form of AI today. It is the practice of training systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. | Recommender systems (Netflix, Amazon), Spam filters.                 |
| **[[Deep Learning]] (DL)**                | A subset of Machine Learning that uses **Artificial [[Neural Networks]]** with many layers (hence, "deep") to process complex data. This is what powers modern breakthroughs.          | Image classification (like CNNs), speech recognition, Generative AI. |
| **[[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP)** | Focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language (text and speech).                                                                                  | Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), machine translation, and chatbots. |
| **[[Computer vision]]**                   | Gives machines the ability to "see" and interpret visual data from the world (images and videos).                                                                                      | Autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and medical image analysis. |
| **Robotics**                              | Integrates AI with physical hardware, enabling robots to perceive their environment, plan, and execute actions autonomously.                                                           | Manufacturing automation, surgical robots, and drones.               |
