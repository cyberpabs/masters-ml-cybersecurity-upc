# Fundamentals of AI - Course Introduction

Welcome to the Fundamentals of AI course notes. This repository serves as a personal knowledge vault for the concepts, paradigms, and algorithms that form the bedrock of Artificial Intelligence.

The course is structured around key themes, progressing from historical context and fundamental definitions to advanced search algorithms, logic, and probabilistic reasoning.
