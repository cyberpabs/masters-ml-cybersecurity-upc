# Unsupervised Learning Overview

Algorithms analyze and cluster unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures without specific human direction. It is primarily used for **data analysis** and **finding correlations** (e.g., customer segmentation).

### Dimensionality Reduction
Techniques for reducing the number of features while retaining maximum information.
* [[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]]

### Clustering (Segmentation)
Grouping similar data points together based on distance.
* **Partitioning**: [[K-Means Clustering]]
* **Hierarchical**: [[Hierarchical Clustering (HAC)]]
* **Density-Based**: [[DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)]] (Placeholder for future notes)

### Association Rule Mining
Finding rules that describe relationships and co-occurrence between items.
