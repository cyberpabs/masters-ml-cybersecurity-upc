The Loss Function (also known as the **Cost Function** or **Objective Function**) is a mathematical function that quantifies the disagreement between a neural network's predicted output ($\hat y$​) and the true, desired output ($y$) for a given set of training data.

In simple terms, it's a measure of the network's error.
