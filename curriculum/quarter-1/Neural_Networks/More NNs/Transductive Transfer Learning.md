This occurs when the source and target tasks are the same, but the datasets (or domains) are different. More specifically, the source data is typically labelled while the target data is unlabeled. Domain adaptation is a form of transductive learning, as it applies knowledge gained from performing a task on one data distribution towards the same task on another data distribution. 

> An example of transductive transfer learning is the application of a text classification model trained and tested on restaurant reviews to classify movie reviews.
