Similar to inductive transfer, as the target and source tasks are different. But in inductive transfer, source and/or target data is often labeled. Per its name, unsupervised transfer learning is unsupervised, meaning there is no manually labeled data. By comparison, inductive transfer can be considered supervised learning. One common application of unsupervised learning is fraud detection. By identify common patterns across an unlabeled dataset of transactions, a model can further learn to identify deviating behaviors as possible fraud.
