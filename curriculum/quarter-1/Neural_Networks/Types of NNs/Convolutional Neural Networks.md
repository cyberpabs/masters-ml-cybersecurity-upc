A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, or **ConvNet**, is a specialized type of MLP network that's exceptionally good at working with **image data**. Input is not numerical, but **n-dimensional** like matrices. 

Its edges do not connect every node and unlike the MLP, which treats every pixel as an independent input, the CNN uses a clever structure to recognize the spatial relationships between nearby pixels.
