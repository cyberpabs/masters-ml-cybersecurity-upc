# Ethical Hacking Principles and Rules of Engagement

To be "ethical," hacking must be performed within a strict set of rules and principles.

## Core Ethical Principles

1. **Legal Authorization:** Always get **explicit written permission** before testing any system.
2. **Honesty & Integrity:** All actions must be transparent.
3. **Responsible Disclosure:** Vulnerabilities are reported **privately** to the organization so they can be fixed.
4. **Skill & Professionalism:** Ethical hackers must have strong technical skills.
5. **Clear Reporting:** All findings must be well-documented and provide actionable recommendations.

## Rules of Engagement (ROE)

The ROE is a formal document that defines the "ground rules" for a penetration test. It ensures all testing stays within legal and ethical boundaries and sets clear expectations.

The ROE typically includes:

- **Start and End Dates:** The specific window for testing.    
- **In-Scope Systems:** What is allowed to be tested.
- **Out-of-Scope Systems:** What is _not_ allowed to be tested (e.g., production servers, third-party systems).
- **Authorized Techniques:** What methods are permitted (e.g., is social engineering allowed? Are DoS attacks banned?).
- **Legal Permissions:** Includes NDAs and a "permission to hack" clause.

## Scope Definition

The **Scope** is a critical part of the ROE. It specifies exactly which systems, applications, networks, or data will be tested and which are off-limits. This prevents accidental damage or unauthorized access to out-of-scope assets.

## Reporting Requirements

This section of the ROE defines how findings will be documented and delivered. It specifies:

- The format of the report (e.g., written summary, technical details).
- Who receives the report.
- The required content, such as:
    - Test activities performed
    - Vulnerabilities found
    - Risk ratings for each vulnerability
    - Actionable recommendations for fixing the issues
    - Proof of concept (if required)
