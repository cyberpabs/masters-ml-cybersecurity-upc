# Machine Learning Overview

This is the main note for the Machine Learning course. The field is essentially about training algorithms to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

The two main types of learning are:
1.  **[[Supervised Learning]]**: Learning from labeled data to map inputs to outputs (e.g., classification, regression).
2.  **[[Unsupervised Learning]]**: Learning from unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).

Before any of this, **[[Data Preparation]]** is crucial. Once models are trained, you need to understand **[[Model Evaluation & Selection]]**.

## Core Concepts
* **Optimization:** The process of adjusting a model’s parameters to minimize its error (Cost Function). The key algorithm for this is **[[Gradient Descent]]**.
* **Cost Function:** Measures the model's performance (error).
