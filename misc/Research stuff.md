# How to read a paper?

Use the 3 scan approach.
## First scan (5-10 minutes)

Steps:
	[ ] Read title, introduction, abstract
	[ ] Read section and sub-section headings (ignore the contents)
	[ ] Glance the mathematical content (if any) to determine theoretical fundations
	[ ] Read conclusions
	[ ] Glance over references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

End of first pass questions (five C's):
		[ ] Category: Type of paper? (Measurement paper, analysis of existing system, description of a research prototype)
		[ ] Context: Which other papers is it related to. Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
		[ ] Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
		[ ] Contributions: What are its main contributions?
		[ ] Clarity: Is the paper well written?

Using this information, you may choose not to read further. This could be because the paper doesn’t interest you, or you don’t know enough about the area to understand the paper.

> The first pass is adequate for papers that aren’t in your research area, but may someday prove relevant.

## Second pass (1 hour approx)

Read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs. Note down terms you didn’t understand, or questions you may want to ask the author.
Steps:
	[ ] Look carrefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Special attention to graphs.
	[ ] Mark relevant unread references for further reading.

After this pass, you should be able to grasp the content of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else.

> Sometimes you won’t understand a paper even at the end of the second pass. This may be because the subject matter is new to you, with unfamiliar terminology and acronyms.

## Third pass
The key to the third pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper. (making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work.)

This pass can take many hours for beginners and more than an hour or two even for an experienced reader. 

> At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points.

## How to do a literature survey:
First use an academic search engine such as **Google Scholar** or **CiteSeer** and some well-chosen **keywords** to find three to five recent highly-cited papers in the area. Do the first pass on each paper to get a sense of the work. Then read their related work sections.
