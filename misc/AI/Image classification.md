Image classification is the process of **assigning a predefined label to an image** based on its visual content. The goal is to enable a model to automatically **recognise patterns, textures and shapes** to categorize images into classes it has learned during training correctly.

For example, a trained model can classify images of animals into categories like "cat", "dog" or "horse" based on features it has extracted from the input images.

## Types of Image Classification

Here are the main types of image classification:

1. [[NN for classification#Binary classification|Binary Classification]]
2. [[NN for classification#Multi-class classification|Multiclass Classification]]
3. [[NN for classification#Multi-label Classification|Multilabel Classification]] 
4. [[NN for classification#Hierarchical Classification|Hierarchical Classification]]
