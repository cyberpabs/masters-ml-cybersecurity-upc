Symbols of calc:
-  $dx$ which merely means "a little bit of x." or "an element of x"
-  $\int$ "the sum of"

Thus $\int dx$ means the sum of all the little bits of $x$ .

The word "integral" means "the whole". If you think of the duration of time for one hour its like 3600 little bits called seconds. The whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make one hour.


Now in the calculus we write $dx$ for a little bit of $x$. These things such as $dx$, and $du$, and $dy$, are called “differentials,” the differential of $x$, or of $u$, or of $y$, as the case may be.

Second differential coefficients will be met with later on. They are like this: $\frac{d^2y}{dx_2}$; and it means that the operation of differentiating $y$ with respect to $x$ has been (or has to be) performed twice over.

Thus if $y=F(x)$ which means that $y$ is some unespecified function of $x$ we may write $F'(x)$ instead of $\frac{d(F(x))}{dx}$. Similarly, $F''(x)$ will mean that the original function $F(x)$ has been differentiated twice over with respect to $x$.
