### Introduction to AI
* **Agent**: Anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. (See [[Historical Background and Core Concepts]])
* **Physical Symbol System Hypothesis (PSSH)**: The idea that a physical system capable of manipulating symbols has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action. (See [[AI Paradigms_ Neat vs Scruffy]])
* **Frame Problem**: The issue of representing the things that do *not* change when an agent performs an action in a formal system.
* **Heuristic**: A "rule of thumb" or evaluation function used to guide search algorithms toward a goal, often trading optimality for speed. (See [[Uninformed and Informed Search]])
* **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**: A problem defined by a set of variables, their possible domains, and a set of constraints that must be satisfied. (See [[Classical Planning and Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)]])
* **Arc Consistency**: A constraint propagation technique in CSPs to prune the domain of a variable based on the constraints with its neighboring variables.
* **Ontology**: A formal specification of a shared conceptualization, often used in [[Description Logics and Ontologies]].
* **Markov Assumption**: The principle that the future state of a system depends only on the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. (See [[Reasoning with Time and Markov Processes]])
